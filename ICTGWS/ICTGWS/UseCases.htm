    <h1>
        List of use cases that my web service implements</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Anonymous/Public – this role does not have a name, and users in this role can request
            resources which do not have the [Authorize] attribute; this role can request basic
            info, like programs, subjects, employees</li>
        <li>Student – select a semester, select their courses, view graded work in a number
            of ways</li>
        <li>Faculty – select a semester, add courses, add graded work</li>
        <li>Coordinator – create a semester, use the app as any student or faculty member</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        More specifically, here are some thoughts about each entity in the app domain data
        model:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Program, Subject, Employee
            <ul>
                <li>Getting all entity’s data list and a specific row of data can be done by Anon/Public,
                    Student, Faculty, and Coordinator. For example, in Fiddler composer, if a Public user chooses "GET" and enters "http://localhost:51161/api/programs",
                    the user will get all programs list. If a Public user chooses "GET" and enters "http://localhost:51161/api/programs/1",
                    the user will get program 1's details.</li>
                <li>Posting and putting data into entity can be done by Coordinator. For example, in Fiddler composer, if the Coordinator chooses "POST", enters some data in JSON format, and enters "http://localhost:51161/api/programs",
                    the Coordinator will add a program to the entity Program. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Student
            <ul>
                <li>Getting all entity’s data list and a specific row of data can be done by Student,
                    Faculty, and Coordinator. For example, in Fiddler composer, if a Student user chooses "GET" and enters "http://localhost:51161/api/students",
                    the user will get all students list. If a Student user chooses "GET" and enters "http://localhost:51161/api/students/1",
                    the user will get Student 1's details.</li>
                <li>Posting, putting and deleting data into entity can be done by Coordinator. For example, in Fiddler composer, if the Coordinator chooses "POST", enters some data in JSON format, and enters "http://localhost:51161/api/students",
                    the Coordinator will add a student to the entity Student. </li>
